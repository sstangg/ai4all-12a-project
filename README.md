# Sounding Out Parkinson's Disease

## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the insidious loss of dopamine-producing cells, primarily within the substantia nigra, leading to uncontrolled neuronal firing and impaired motor control. While PD is currently incurable, prompt treatment following an early diagnosis has been shown to improve patients' quality of life significantly  (Solana-Lavalle et.al, 2010). 

This project addresses this crucial need by researching and training supervised machine learning classification models to identify PD based on a rich dataset of speech features extracted from recorded voices, thus offering a non-invasive and highly accessible diagnostic tool.
